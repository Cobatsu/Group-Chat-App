# Group-Chat App
This application allows users to create rooms and have conversations. I built this application to improve my GraphQL and Apollo skills. I believe that I gained many valuable experiences regarding the GraphQL-Apollo structure during the development of this application.

Tools and techs I used in this project:
----------------------------
* JWT
* GraphQL
* Apollo Client/Server
* React JS
* Node JS
* MongoDB


What can users do ?
----------------------

* Users can create and delete rooms.
* Users can join and leave rooms.
* Users can create, delete, reply and update the messages.
* Users can see the number of unread messages.
